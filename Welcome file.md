# Introduction  

- This project is an online stock trading simulation REST API which can perform certain tasks such as create, retrieve, update stock information  such as account details of certain organisations like create an account, withdraw money from the account and deposit into the account.    
-  This application can be used by front-end developers, mobile developers, and traders can utilize this REST API  
- The application was built using certain technologies like MicroService which is implemented with SpringBoot and created PSQL database to store and perform DDL and DML commands with IEX market data.
     

# Quick Start  

- Prequiresites: Java, Docker, CentOS 7  
       
   - Java 8
   - Maven
   - PostgreSQL
   -  Docker
   - IEX token access ([https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/))
 ## Intializing 
  

 Clone git repository
 

    git clone https://github.com/Pranavi25/trading-app
Build Maven 

    mvn install -DSkipTests
Initializing the app

    bash run_trading_app.sh JDBC_HOST JDBC_USER JDBC_PASSWORD IEX_PUB_TOKEN
To use this REST API Swagger is utilised.
This application uses Swagger UI which enables the front developers, mobile developers to perform certain operations on it. This can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) when the application is in run mode.
**Note**: The above URL works if you are running the application on the same server as you are using this URL.




    

   
     

# REST API Usage  

## Swagger  

Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. 
-   Design-first users: To use  Swagger Codegen  to  generate a server stub  for your API. The only thing left is to implement the server logic – and the API is ready to go live.

## Quote Controller  

- High-level description for this controller. Where is market data coming from (IEX) and how did you cache the quote data (PSQL). Briefly talk about data from within your app  - briefly explain your endpoints in this controller   
   - GET `/quote/dailyList`: list all securities that are available to trading in this trading system   
   - PUT `/quote/iexMarketData`: Update all quotes from IEX which is an external market data source  

## Trader Controller  

- High-level description for trader controller(e.g. it can manage trader and account information. it can deposit and withdraw fund from a given account)  - briefly explain your endpoints in this controller  ##Order Controller  - High-level description for this controller.  - briefly explain your endpoints in this controller   
   - /order/MarketOrder: explain what is a market order, and how does your business logic work.  

## App controller  

- GET `/health` to make sure SpringBoot app is up and running  

## Optional(Dashboard controller)   
     

# Architecture  

- Draw a component diagram which contains controller, service, DAO, storage layers (you can mimic the diagram from the guide)  - briefly explain the following logic layers or components (3-5 sentences for each)   
   - Controller   
   - Service   
   - Dao   
   - SpringBoot: webservlet/TomCat and IoC   
   - PSQL and IEX

# Introduction

-   Briefly explain what does this project do (e.g. it an online stock trading simulation REST API which can blah…blah) and who can use this API (e.g. front-end developer, mobile developer, and traders can utilize this REST API)
-   Briefly talk about technologies used in this project(e.g. It’s a MicroService which is implemented with SpringBoot. PSQL database. IEX market data)

# Quick Start

-   Prequiresites: Java, Docker, CentOS 7
-   PSQL init
-   git clone and mvn build
-   Start Springboot app using a shell script
    -   describe env vars
-   How to consume REST API? (Swagger screenshot and postman with OpenAPI Specification, e.g. [http://35.231.122.184:5000/v2/api-docs](http://35.231.122.184:5000/v2/api-docs)

# REST API Usage

## Swagger

What’s swagger (1-2 sentences, you can copy from swagger docs). Why are we using it or who will benefit from it?

## Quote Controller
