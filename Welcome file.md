# Introduction  

- This project is an online stock trading simulation REST API which can perform certain tasks such as create, retrieve, update stock information  such as account details of certain organisations like create an account, withdraw money from the account and deposit into the account.    
-  This application can be used by front-end developers, mobile developers, and traders can utilize this REST API  
- The application was built using certain technologies like MicroService which is implemented with SpringBoot and created PSQL database to store and perform DDL and DML commands with IEX market data.
     

# Quick Start  

- Prequiresites: Java, Docker, CentOS 7  
       
   - Java 8
   - Maven
   - PostgreSQL
   -  Docker
   - IEX token access ([https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/))
 ## Intializing 
  

 Clone git repository
 

    git clone https://github.com/Pranavi25/trading-app
Build Maven 

    mvn install -DSkipTests
Initializing the app

    bash run_trading_app.sh JDBC_HOST JDBC_USER JDBC_PASSWORD IEX_PUB_TOKEN
To use this REST API Swagger is utilised.
This application uses Swagger UI which enables the front developers, mobile developers to perform certain operations on it. This can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html) when the application is in run mode.
**Note**: The above URL works if you are running the application on the same server as you are using this URL.

# REST API Usage  

## Swagger  

Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. 
-   Design-first users: To use  Swagger Codegen  to  generate a server stub  for your API. The only thing left is to implement the server logic â€“ and the API is ready to go live.

## Quote Controller  

The quote controller handles different requests related to information on the securities. These securities can be traded using this application. The securities such as asking price, biding price, asking size, biding size are few information that is retrieved from IEX cloud and then stored in tabular format using PSQL database.
  
   - GET `/quote/dailyList`: list all securities that are available to trading in this trading system  
   - GET`/quote/iex/ticker/{ticker}`: Displays information regarding the ticker from IEX cloud.
   - POST`/quote/tickerId/{tickerId}`: In order to add a new ticker to the existing database.	 
   - PUT `/quote/iexMarketData`: Update all quotes from IEX which is an external market data source
   - PUT`/quote/`: Update only one quote in quote table. 

## Trader Controller  

- It can manage trader and account information by implementing certain operations like create, deposit and withdraw funds from a given account.  
### Endpoints in this controller
-   DELETE `/trader/traderId/{traderId}`: To delete a trader and their account provided there is no money in the account and no open positions for that trader's account
-   POST `/trader/`: To create a new trader and an account
-   POST `/trader/firstname/{firstname}/lastname/{lastname}/dob/{dob}/country/{country}/email/{email}`: create a new trader and account with above details
-   PUT `/trader/deposit/traderId/{traderId}/amount/{amount}`: To deposit an amount in a given account
-   PUT `/trader/withdraw/traderId/{traderId}/amount/{amount}`: To withdraw an amount from a given account  

## Order Controller  
-  The order controller controls the buy and sell of a security. 
### Endpoint controller
- POST `order/MarketOrder`: To buy a security it is possible only if there is sufficient funds in their account. To sell a security it is possible if the account has enough position of the security. 

## App controller  
The whole and main purpose of this is to make the application up and running.
- GET `/health` : To make sure SpringBoot app is up and running  



# Architecture  

- component diagram which contains controller, service, DAO, storage layers

- Work flow:
   - Controller: It handles HTTP Request to the REST API. It parses the user input and then invokes the corresponding method. 
   - Service: The main business logic is implemented at this level. It validates user inputs and invokes the corresponding Dao methods.   
   - Dao: Data Access Object takes the input from service layer and then uses to store it in the database.   
   - SpringBoot: webservlet/TomCat and IoC: This is a spring framework which is a container which couples different services together and binds them. It is invoked by just running it.   
   - PSQL: The PostgreSQL is the database that is used in this project to store tables. The structure of the database for this particular application is database: jrvstrading, tables: quote, order, trader. 
   - IEX: This is a REST API. 
     

# Improvements  

- To provide traders multiple accounts access
- Make data updates quick and efficient.
- Provide additional features apart from create, deposit and withdraw funds from an account.
